HARDWARE*:
    Physical components that a computer is made up of:

    * (CPU): Central Processing Unit:
        part of a computer that actually runs programs. The CPU is the most important component
        in a computer because without it, the computer could not run software. 

        the central processing unit consists of two parts: the control unit and the arithmetic and logic unit {ALU). The control unit coordinates all of the compurer's operations.
        It is responsible for determining where to get the next instruction and regulating the other
        major components of the computer with control signals. The arithmetic and logic unit, as
        its name suggests, is designed to perform mathematical operations
